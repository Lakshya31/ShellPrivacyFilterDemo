Jim:  Your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.  I've certainly had some  troubles this quarter.  I do appreciate your offer but I don't want to take  away from the amazing year you've had so far.  Maybe you should come trade  this...

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really  great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their  control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could  have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what  you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This  especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3  months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX  liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million  out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never  have done what I've done.    Thanks,    Jim Schwieger
Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe  d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....  Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to  have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll  see you guys there.  Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's  the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again  soon....  Take care! Amy

To answer your question:  It is looking  more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using  approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have  input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a  tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.    I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s)  which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both  days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day  meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G.  certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems  Engineer(s).  I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be  going, and for which days.

EBS sell with,  and/or through the Avaya sales organization   The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS  development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:    1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above,  discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues  and opportunities and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which  could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions   to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &  marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both  days due to the nature of his mission.   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Please let me know as soon as you can which day or  days would work best for you to make the trip.

Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as  wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.   Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it  couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve  told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than  is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an  Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling  it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g,  cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage  economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of  winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.   Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys  are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it  going to zero?     slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: re:mkts    agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up  buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month  fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time  is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have  the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called  impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate  at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.    also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in  the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree?   be cool my man-talk later

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.  http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com  Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the  application.   Here is the steps they should do:  1) Launch Internet Explorer  2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and  click on above URL)  3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If  they don't see any messages, there are two reasons:   (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT  Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names  into the group.  (2) There is no new messages added yet.  4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window  when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the  messages after typing the  messages into the text box:  (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or  (2) click on "send" button to send the message.  5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main  window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message  in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.  However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10  second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will  be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the  messages.  6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM.

Hey: Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others  wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6  months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are  amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will  be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely  implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.   Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.   interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.   definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until  latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be  unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one  year ago and not a significant loss of demand.    market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a  very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.   Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been  significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they  are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some  back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5  considering the scenario that's being painted.        slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM To: jarnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: re:mkts    johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled  all the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was  long mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early   flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.     but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to  mark silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out.  any great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.    guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling  dry up??

The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It  also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data   contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no  longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of  generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets  around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were  significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and  deregulation at the state level.    - NGM11_00.pdf

Jennifer:  Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity  with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James  Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and  cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it  overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary  King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?  Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ     Mr. Thompson:  Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband  Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate  broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike  Rabon in the October 6th meeting.   Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had  expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to  it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs  assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it  pertains to: Near term network planning. IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential. IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet  transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit  capacity. Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for  managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy  storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about  your storage strategy and growth. Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the  actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the  hubs. Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality  H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron  IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be  significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's  utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic  and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to  speak to the Video Conferencing product manager. Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be  communicated to the proper person.
The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate  unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November  8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and  Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore  count as a total of four deals.       We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as  just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL  Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals  are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this  currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most  conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results  in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.  If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.  Pete Berzins x57597
Dear Mr.. Lavorato,  The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.  Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.  2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.  For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.  REGARDS MARIA.

John,  Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for Enron North America: job # 0000105886.  My primary strengths are:  Natural gas asset acquisition and management Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and derivatives execution Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads, storage, physical presence Good customer relations/account development Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities Stong negotiator  I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every trend imaginable in leveraging itself.  I appreciate any help you can provide.  Thanks.

Fernley:  We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including  sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that  have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I  would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident  that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

Thad,  Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us  which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual  meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to  choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the  western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in  NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th  of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.    However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I  need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives'  availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The  meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for  the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of  meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible  alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:  1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential  solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and 2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to  determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the  (common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through"  (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as  sales channels for each other's sales forces.  These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would  include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss  areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value  propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a  go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of  some of the  "EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item  #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be  addressed.  Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for  your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to  Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days  synchronized with your executives'.

Jennifer,  I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably  about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:  Based on the following, I would say this:  1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works,  and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully. 2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or  acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore 3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify  what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works. 4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any  of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided  any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on  11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for  information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation,  Net Works?" from Net Works. 5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by  Net Works) than will be discussed, because 6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.  7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net  Works' folks are concerned.  In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a  heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this  morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I  don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and  implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business  unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were  likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended  against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.    If you have any questions, please let me know.

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the  deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on  the deal.   Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical  deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.       	 	 	From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PM 	  To: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John  Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S  Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal  The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for  roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured  deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the  next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken  care of.   In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and  CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against  the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from  December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from  roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is  17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the  producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with  more details.   There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to  clarify.   First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like  payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both  the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the  December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment  would take place on February 15, 2000.   Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and  Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we  would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron  Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million.  (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've  done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).    There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with  the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with  EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston.  However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this  transaction.  CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split  it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting  with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one.  Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end  of this week.   Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.  Regards, Russ

There is a process  that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with  existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it  is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must  be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the  desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to  install the application itself.  Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed  with IE5 and provides real time chat.  I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at  this time.

Jennifer, In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97  figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after  speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not  included in this figure.    The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is  currently being tabulated).

Hi,  We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:  1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50 2 .

The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming -  $ 770.00  So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8  days.

Adam: Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so,  unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.    As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.   Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't  know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron  appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.    The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the  trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask  any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would  probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the  training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement  though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure  trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of  other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall  under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the  head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.  Write me about how your interviews went. Good luck: John     "Adam Bayer" <adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu> on 10/19/2000 03:28:57 PM To: <john.arnold@enron.com> cc:   Subject: How are you today   Hi John,  How are you today?

Do you have any tips on approaching the interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have any tips I would love to hear them.

Enron Global Strategic Sourcing Sourcing Portfolio Leader - Construction Services (713) 646-7028     ----- Forwarded by Daniel Coleman/NA/Enron on 12/04/2000 10:51 AM -----  	Bob Hamlin <bhamlin@vulcaninc.com> 	11/02/2000 04:26 PM 		  		 To: "'daniel.coleman@enron.com'" <daniel.coleman@enron.com> 		 cc:  		 Subject: Change Places   Hello  I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in Houston.  We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is beginning to flow.   On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the signed contract is "on the way".  The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to provide/supply natural gas to our company.  We consume quite a bit of natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace.   I believe last year we spent about $500,000.  As we both know the price of natural gas is rising.  It never hurts to check and see if better deals are out there.  If this is of any interest, please pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle.  The can contact me first and then I will turn over to our person here.  Thanks  Bob Hamlin Vice President Vulcan Utility Signs & Products 800-426-1314

can you find out if the tech group has scheduled installation of a dsl line  in my apartment?
It's funny the spreads in gas.  First, in gas, you can play the seasonality  game.  Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.  No, of course not.  But in  crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month  on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads  and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.   that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.   when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt  month.  i can't remember w/o looking at charts.  it's always the mentality  of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.  i think that's  why the winter spreads are a piece.  the z/f/g fly is interesting.  i think  z/f can and will settle backw.  just a high prob it goes cantango first. Still seeing sellside interest in term.  definitely a result of pira.  will  probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them  and watches the front of the curve.  previous to that conference, the  producers just didnt want to sell anything.  tired of writing us a big check  every month. so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so  i can work at home at night.  it's really my only time to sit and think  without the phones and eol going crazy.  they better pay me for the decline  in my lifestyle .     slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/15/2000 09:26:31 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: Re: mkts    what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again  the numbers but pretty sure they said  +3 bcf by dec. ill let you  know/its been along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.     some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk  too they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be  hard to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds  until all the length bails.     your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at  pira including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.    fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you  be careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on  oil side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks getting hit lately??    good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you  some interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.     by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.

Savita: A couple of issues:  1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis  child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?  2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they  meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas  dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually  I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm  restricted right now by issue #1.  Please advise, John
