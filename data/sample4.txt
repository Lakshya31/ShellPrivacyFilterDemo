John,   Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer  transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and  2005.     They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday  and Thursday.  Phillip
George,   Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate  project:   Ownership Structure   What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?   What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what  capacity(regarding ownership and   liabilities)?   Who owns the land? improvements?   Who holds the various loans?   Is the land collateral?   Investment    What happens to initial investment?   Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?    Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?   When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment  schedule?   Investment Return   Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?   Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits  are distributed?   Debt   Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral  is associated with each   loan?   Improvement   Construction   Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.   Terms of each loan?   Uses of Funds   How will disbursements be made?  By whom?   What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing  for investors?   Reports to track expenses vs plan?   Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?   What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get  paid a markup on subcontractors as a   general contractor and paid gain out of profits?   Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?   Design and Construction    When will design be complete?   What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?   What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?   Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?   Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?   Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.  Phillip
---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000  04:35 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>  Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls   Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen
Jeff,   What is up with Burnet?  Phillip
Jeff,   I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written  approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has  concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like  to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip
Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy  of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct  amounts and I will input.
Brenda,   I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on  August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I  will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can  treat the 2nd as payment for October.   I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without  getting the details and getting your approval.   I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip
please remove my name and information from the registered user list.  Do not  sell my information.  Phillip Allen

Jeff,   I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I  am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.  I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out  when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?   What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember  we have to get Brenda happy.  Phillip
9/8  9/7  diff  Socal  36,600  37,200  -600  NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250  San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500   The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the  transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan  and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and  sold 800 Socal.
why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO?   What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?
Jeff,   You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.     I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which   I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering  properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?   I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.    Phillip

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. Sincerely, George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

Folks,  I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I think will be interesting to the group.  I highly recommend David Moore's book "The Roman Pantheon" at $25.00  -   a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.   <A HREF="http://www.romanconcrete.com/">Roman Concrete Research by David Moore</A>   Regards,  Harry Francis

saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate  margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the  front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter  today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong  on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk  premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access,  down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish  to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments  for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was  trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of  probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that  has to be reflected in h/j.     slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/13/2000 04:15:51 PM To: slafontaine@globalp.com cc: John.Arnold@enron.com  Subject: re:spreads    mkt getting a little more bearish the back of winter i think-if we get another cold blast jan/feb mite move out. with oil moving down and march closer flat  px wide to jan im not so bearish these sprds now-less bullish march april as  well.
amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under  such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.    will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually  be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in  f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec  length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to  some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?     slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/08/2000 12:05:54 PM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: re:summer inverses    i suck-hope youve made more money in natgas last 3 weeks than i have. mkt shud be getting bearish feb forward-cuz we already have the weather upon us-fuel switching and the rest shud invert the whole curve not just dec cash to jan  and feb forward???? have a good weekend john

Savita: A couple of issues:  1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis  child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?  2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they  meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas  dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually  I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm  restricted right now by issue #1.  Please advise, John

pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer  selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most  selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect  these days.  Too much, probably. The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in  natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March  and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.   These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there  were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made  a penny.   Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.     slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/13/2000 09:42:43 AM To: jarnold@enron.com cc:   Subject: mkts    cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01 and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend johnny. pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!

We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during  the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but  assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is "NG-OPT-XL-PRC") For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June:  June 1st  $797 million dollars loss June 2nd +192 million dollars made June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)  This problem makes it impossible to backtest....  Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the  allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily  increasing your limit to $45 million.

Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later  flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the  market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that  sucked.

Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.

Adam: Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly  identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I  would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's  happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the  LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks,  the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I  still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals  and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.   The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.   It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Thank you for the dinner last night. I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in a more relaxed setting.   During out conversation yesterday, I was confused about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking, is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job, or is it meant to bypass traders completely.  Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward to talking with you again when you come to campus for interviews.

A funny story: Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of  unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the  exchange stopped trading for an hour.   Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything  was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange  closing.  One yelled at Rappaport... "Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"

We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked  great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without  getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.  The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded.   We could keep it between you and Mike.   We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them  who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea  of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.   I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an  update of who we are planning to trade with.  Best Rgds, Caroline
Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an  extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.   As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty.  I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This  was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since  been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.    Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise. Thanks,  John

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product  priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really  shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the  predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.    One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new  product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated  basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated  basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec  Nymex.  Any ideas?

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how  you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so  dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could  produce that effect.   The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into  the winter. John       	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Frank Hayden @ ENRON                           09/15/2000 06:32 PM 	  To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sunil Dalal/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Stress Test  The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the  $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price  curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the  price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX  volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.   Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%   $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134%            It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the  financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the  seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces  risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that  the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and  increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?
