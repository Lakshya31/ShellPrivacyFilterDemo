Here is our forecast
Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.
test successful.  way to go!!!
Randy,   Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the  scheduling group.  Plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made.   (Patti S for example)  Phillip
Let's shoot for Tuesday at 11:45.
Greg,   How about either next Tuesday or Thursday?  Phillip

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that  point.

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000  01:09 PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Phillip K Allen                           09/28/2000 10:56 AM 	   Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.    2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different.    I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.   It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.  Sincerely,  Phillip Allen

Crocker"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000  04:26 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, "Claudia L. Crocker"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

Reagan,  Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.  Phillip

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.?

If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.?  ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.?  This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.?  ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even  needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my  signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it  reviewed before I accept it. ? Brenda ? ?

Kathy,  Regarding the guest password for gas daily, can you please relay the  information to Mike Grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at  gas daily today.  I will be out of the office on Friday.  thank you  Phillip
John,   Denver's short rockies position  beyond 2002 is created by their Trailblazer  transport.  They are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and  2005.     They are scrubbing all their books and booking the Hubert deal on Wednesday  and Thursday.  Phillip
Jim,  Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.  Phillip
George,   Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate  project:   Ownership Structure   What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?   What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what  capacity(regarding ownership and   liabilities)?   Who owns the land? improvements?   Who holds the various loans?   Is the land collateral?   Investment    What happens to initial investment?   Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?    Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?   When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment  schedule?   Investment Return   Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?   Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits  are distributed?   Debt   Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral  is associated with each   loan?   Improvement   Construction   Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.   Terms of each loan?   Uses of Funds   How will disbursements be made?  By whom?   What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing  for investors?   Reports to track expenses vs plan?   Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?   What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get  paid a markup on subcontractors as a   general contractor and paid gain out of profits?   Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?   Design and Construction    When will design be complete?   What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?   What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?   Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?   Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?   Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.  Phillip
---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000  04:35 PM ---------------------------   "George Richards" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: "Phillip Allen" <pallen@enron.com> cc: "Larry Lewter" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>  Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls   Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC    - Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls
George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen
Jeff,   What is up with Burnet?  Phillip
Jeff,   I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written  approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has  concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like  to review the closing statements as soon as possible.  Phillip
Lucy,  I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy  of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct  amounts and I will input.
Brenda,   I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on  August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I  will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can  treat the 2nd as payment for October.   I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without  getting the details and getting your approval.   I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.  Phillip
Lucy,   You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on  Labor.      June  July  August  Total Materials  2929  4085  4801  Services  53  581  464  Labor   3187  3428  2770       Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):  1.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

Jeff,   I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I  am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.  I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out  when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?   What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember  we have to get Brenda happy.  Phillip
9/8  9/7  diff  Socal  36,600  37,200  -600  NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250  San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500   The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the  transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan  and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and  sold 800 Socal.
why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO?   What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?
Jeff,   You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood.     I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which   I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering  properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you  perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a  project from scratch?   I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.    Phillip

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. Sincerely, George W. Richards Creekside Builders, LLC

Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.   I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.     Call or email with your thoughts.  Phillip

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. "That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries."                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          "These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads," said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          "The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts."                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          "It is probably the largest data center park in the  country," boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          "We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          "It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. "The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way."

Mark,   Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal  basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that  reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints  before and after bidweek.             The following observations can be made:    July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs  actual of .79    2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91    3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.    Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs  actual of .99    2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49    3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the  monthly postings    4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.        Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against  the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any  questions.  Phillip

Brad,   With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial  manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an  associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a  commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to  others in that category at year end.     Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.   Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.   Let me know if there are any issues.  Phillip
Bruce,  Can you stop by and set up my reuters.  Phillip
Lucy,   The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add  these modifications:   1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It  should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.   2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.   =e6-g6.   3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width  is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the         letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.   4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to  this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.  Phillip
Lucy,  I got your email with the attachment.  Let's work together today to get this  done  Phillip
you have my approval
Lucy,   We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the  spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to  an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two  files.  Phillip
Lucy,  Please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week.   Then email the file back.
Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it  is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1). You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we  have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates  described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice  excel.

Mac,   Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:    Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year      Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf    Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.      Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this  looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine,  Tosco, and SLB?   Thank you,   Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind  of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going  to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.     What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?  Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.  Thanks,  Phillip

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.
Colleen,   I am out ot the office on Friday, but Keith Holst will attend.  He has been  managing the Transport on the west desk.  Phillip
Lucy,   Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we  need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.   First, I want to implement the following changes:    1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.   2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily   3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank   4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic  operations.    Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all  the checks since Jan. 1.  When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow  highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.  Please gather receipts so we can discuss.  Phillip

can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved  curves each night.  Here is an example that pulls socal only. Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice  of index,gd, or our curves.
