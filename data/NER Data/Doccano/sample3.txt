Lucy,   Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we  need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.   First, I want to implement the following changes:    1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.   2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily   3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank   4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic  operations.    Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all  the checks since Jan. 1.  When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow  highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.  Please gather receipts so we can discuss.  Phillip

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

But adversity teaches          us more important lessons than prosperity.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.  The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-  (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	 	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.   	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	 (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen  	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. 	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence 	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.  I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.  Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.  If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.  Happy New Year  Louise

Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.

[mailto:Phillip.K.Allen@ENRON.com] Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM To: Morgan, Richard Subject:   Richard,  I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.  I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf. That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective? Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.  Thank you for your help.

Phillip & Keith  Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.  Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).  I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00. I look forward to hearing from you.   Greg     - Draw # 1 - 10.25.01.xls

Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-  +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett  The rest will be completed shortly.  We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Phillip,  This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.  As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.  Thanks,  Renee   -----Original Message----- From: 	Allen, Phillip K.   Sent:	Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:26 AM To:	Ratcliff, Renee Subject:	  Renee,  Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.  Thank you,  Phillip Allen
Your Internet Banking accounts are now setup again for accessing. The login id is still your main acct. # with the password being reset to the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).  You will then be directed to a screen that asks for information such as: Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire.  Always remember that your password is case sensitive. One major change is the wording of your accounts names (they have changed to product types and not descriptions). You can change your account descriptions by clicking on the Nicknames button and entering your own account description.  We are still working on getting the information to post again correctly (your old account information has been removed, and we hope to have this information converted shortly and back on-line), so you will notice that credits and debits do not show up in the appropriate columns. Transaction descriptions are correct and the balances information is correct as of our last day of processing (11/16/01).  We appreciate your patience and continued support. Our goal is to be fully operational and all information corrected before the holiday season.  Please make sure to record any suggestions (or problems) that you might have concerning our web site.  Again, thanks for banking with State Bank & Trust and happy surfing.  Sincerely,  Howard Gordon Network Administrator hgordon@state-bank.com
To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:  We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions. The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.  2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.  3)  If you see this error message "Invalid login; please try again" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always remember that your password is case sensitive.  Should you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and transactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We will have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then information will be as of Monday (11/19/01). Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to continuing to service your IBS needs in the future.  Sincerely,  Howard Gordon Network Manager   - geninfo.vcf
Phillip Good Morning! I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family and safe travels.  As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role of producint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will be obtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you for your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:  Number of SMEs needed:  10 Number of expert stories: 20-25 Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a mix of structurers, originators and traders   I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will follow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main difference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of 11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with them for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at least 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.  (11/26-11/28)                          --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs (11/28-11/30)                          --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding the simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to discuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot. (12/3-12/6)                --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we need and where they can provide stories.                           --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the stories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video shoot.                           --Make changes to stories, if necessary.                           --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to SMEs (12/10-12/12)                           --Video shoot  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).  Sheri  When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a "Dateline" type theme for one, and a "60 Minute" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Your comments were incorporated in the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference to your concern over "locking in a price" as collusion, those were Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Team FYI  Sheri The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls & meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails. This will keep me in the loop. Thanks  Phillip If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon as possible.

Phillip;  Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.  I was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.  Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft costs. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.

Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.  I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.  In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.

Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to=  you     -----Original Message----- From: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20 Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:=09FW:=20   Greg,  After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de= ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg= arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis= tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe= nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision = of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a= s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re= ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=  of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=  of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ= rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield= s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St= ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha= res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i= n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th= at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o= f Enron Corp. common stock.  There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=   section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.= "  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se= ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no= t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib= ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay= ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.  The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that = is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t= he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val= ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin= g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay= ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=   This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=  share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most = beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor= p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se= ction 6.3.  The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=  distribution under each of the three interpretations:     Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1  Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar= es Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13 Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658 10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866 Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792 Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10 Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares  I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.    Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.  Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.          Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.
Phillip,  I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding storage.  Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?  Thank you for your help.

To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.  We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.  To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).  Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message "You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.  2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always remember that your password is case sensitive.  Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.  Sincerely,  Howard Gordon Network Manager   - geninfo.vcf

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.      At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.      "What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."      Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.      Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.      "Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.      PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend.      At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.  -Robert Scalabrino   PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas       Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.      "Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning," said one PJM-based trader. "By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up."      Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices.      Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements.      In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.      Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices       Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00.      Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.      Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand.      Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.      "The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses," one trader said. "These are much more realistic prices."      Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.      "What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice," one MAPP trader said.      "Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off," he said, "and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast       Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said.      Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.      "There was nothing going on in Florida today," said one southern energy trader. "Everything was going to markets in the north."      Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.      "Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out," said on Entergy power trader. "Prices, declined to $60 and less."      The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates.      Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region.      In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices.      "The cold weather's backing off," said one SPP utility trader. "It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."      Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.  -Brian Whary    U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand       London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.      The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.      December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.      December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.      First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said.      January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.      First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.      Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed.  -Nick Livingstone   Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast       Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.      Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing.      Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating.      Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said.      "The market's been waiting for this day for a long time," a Stockholm-based trader said. "For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."      Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling.      Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.      Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.      Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts.      Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said.      Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.      Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.  -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT =0F$    - daily.pdf

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the "socalprices" spread sheet  supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where  did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.  As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our  comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the  charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much  better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the  whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.  Thanks.

The data I have received thus far are summarized in the  following paragraphs.  The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or  curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.  The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations  or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.  A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a  lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.  Don Badley

Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons  for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from  legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some  response.  Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market.   We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be  included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

Leslie,after seeing point # 3 in writing , I would be extremely reluctant to  submit. This kind of conjecture about  market manipulation , coming from us.  would only serve to fuel the fires of the naysayers- I would delete. Thanks.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.      "Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline," said one Southwest trader.      According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.      At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.      Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.      At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.      According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal.      "We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop," said one Northwest trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00.      According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.  -Robert Scalabrino   Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand       Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.      According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.      In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday.      "There's just no weather out there," said one PJM-based trader. "There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long."      Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday.      Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow.      Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities.      The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk.      Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up       Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said.      "It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there," one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. "Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that."      The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.      Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.      Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.      "Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices," an ECAR trader said.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume.      Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.      For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.      "There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too," one MAPP trader said. "It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up       Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.      Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday.      Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.       The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.      On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.      In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.      "There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have," said one Texas-based utility power trader. "Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."      On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36.      Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.      Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.      In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said.      On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted.  -Brian Whary   U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids       London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said.      Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday.      The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said.      Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.      June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.      On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week.      Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said.  -Amal Halawi   Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest       Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said.      Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.      "The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. "I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.''      Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a "more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.''      Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a "high'' spot price for this time of the year.      Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged.      Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.  -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT =0F$    - daily.pdf

Karen,  Can you tell me when Matt Smith and Jason Wolfe are scheduled to move to new rotations?  Also what are their next assignments.  I would like to move Matt Smith into an assistant trading rotation and have Jason move in to Matt's current rotation in the fundamentals group.  Phillip
Greg,  I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.  Will it do?  If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty. Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.  I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.  If it is ok please forward to Montez.
Jeanie,  Please change Janie Tholt's ranking to a 3.
