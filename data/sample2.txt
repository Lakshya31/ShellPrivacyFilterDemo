Lucy,  Here is the rentroll.  My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special  reasons?  It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run  an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine. I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can  use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good  idea whether the sale is going through.  Phillip
I also need to know the base salaries of Jay Reitmeyer and Monique Sanchez.   They are doing the same job as Matt.

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.
Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the  detailed worksheet that you mentioned.  I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones  granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of  restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be  kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have  fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?  Thank you for looking into this issue.  Phillip

The  summary  presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions.
Gentlemen,  Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to  date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is  still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed.    We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that.    Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp  Flores can be used.  Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very  optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.  Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about  moving this project forward.  Phillip

Jacques,  George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He  wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.    We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to  determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect  work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation  for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were  proposing was unsupportable by the market.    My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?   Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I  wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I  want to respond to their offer asap.  Call me with your thoughts.

George,  I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send  it this morning.    We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs.  (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)      - MAPTTRA.xls

Darrell,  Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his  excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the  land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like  to proceed and develop the property.    My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would  also like to compare construction and development services between what you  can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.   Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to  be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural  work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is  Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about  either.  I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.  Phillip

George,  I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.  After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.  Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives.  Phillip

Please find attached the pro formas for the project in San Marcos.  Thanks again.
Lucy,  Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:  #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is  not on any rentroll that I can see.  #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she  will start paying on #9  #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to  collect the $95 in question.  #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?  #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.   Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.  #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of  the year.  #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't  see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?  The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to  figure these out immediately.  I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll  in case you need to research these questions.  I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be  able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary  on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.  Phillip
George,  I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between  March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.  Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your  time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The  items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just  clarification of what was in a number.    Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow  morning.    Phillip
George,   The numbers on your fax don't agree to the first estimate that I am using.   Here are the two files I used.       Phillip

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##

The principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates.  The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.  The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this loan is obtained.  Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.  George W.

They do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today, and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.  AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

John,  Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies  forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.  Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:  1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,  TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the         parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and  TAGG but the issues facing         scheduling in Unify are grey.  2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up"  policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need  further      scrutiny.  3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training  courses, review progress and make cuts.  5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at  everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add     some value and direction to the group.   In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD  to work part time to get it done.  Phillip
The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you  consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment  and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be  used much more.  Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any  time of day.  Let me know if this is possible.  Phillip Allen X37041
it is ok with me.
That would we very helpful.    Thanks,  Phillip

Jaques,  After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different  definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of "construction management"  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip
George,  Please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.  Phillip
Jeanie,  Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into  part time.  Nice confidentiality.

Lucy,  Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your  earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.  But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to  this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and  send it back.  Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send  you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.  Phillip
no.  I am on msn messenger.

Thanks for the website.
Lucy,   Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.   It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to  the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the  rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or  $20 to get things full, go ahead.   I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.  Phillip
Colleen,  I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on  January 2nd versus February 11:     1/2  2/11  Stanfield to Malin 209  81  SJ/Perm. to Socal 896  251  Sj to Socal  2747  768  PGE/Top to Citygate 51  3  PGE/Top to KRS 16  4  SJ to Valero  916  927   If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value  since the beginning of the year.  Can you confirm that I am looking at the  right numbers?   Phillip

The structure they are looking for is a firm physical  sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do  this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.   Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few  producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

If they can really build this  many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously  it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard  to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is  subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the  El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Lucy,  Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject  to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.  It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there  unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.  When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize  that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.    Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes  if you need to.      Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and  refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form  to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this  information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.  It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with  the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I  mean.  Talk to you later,  Phillip

Lucy,  Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.    There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.  1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank  is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the  spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.  2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?  3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?  4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?  5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?  6.  #14  missed on 2/2?  7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?  8.  #20a missed on 2/2?  9.  #35 missed on 2/2?  My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.   You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on  some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the  bank deposit.  Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade  last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.  I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet  them?  If so, what did you think?  Phillip
I will email you an updated operating statement with Nov and Dec tomorrow  morning.  What did the seguin doctor think of the place.    How much could I get the stagecoach appraised for?  Do you still do  appraisals?  Could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap?
Jacques,  Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?    The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com

Jeff,  My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip
Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip
Susan,  Raised your issue to Sally Beck.  Larry is going to spend time with you to  see if he can live without any reports.  Also some IT help should be on the  way.  Phillip

What is  going on?  #25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit  #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?  I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with  email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know  that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the  property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show  them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.    Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right  now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet  but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade  continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the  property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and  better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.    Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It  is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move  in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I  realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and  your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be  working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running  an errand for the property.  I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this  time.  We can look at again later in the year.  I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.  Phillip

Can you arrange it?   ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/02/2001  03:00 PM ---------------------------   Larry May@ENRON 02/02/2001 12:43 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan M  Scott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Errol McLaughlin/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book  As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book)  was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200  am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the  West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in  order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at  2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time  fits in your schedules.  Thanks,  Larry
Susan hours are out of hand.  We need to find a solution.  Let's meet on  Monday to assess the issue  Phillip
Got your email.  I will let Jacques know.  I guess we can work out the finer  points next week.  The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors  this week, so unfortunately I did not hear from them this week.  The are  promising to have some feedback by Monday.  I will let you know as soon as I  hear from them.  Phillip
George,  The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted  to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.   The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.    I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would  like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I  would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I  would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we  didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.   Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.   pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)   Phillip Allen   PS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in  Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.  You  should try their website or call the station to get the full story.  It would  makes a good case for breathable walls.
8500?????  That's twice as valuable as your car!  Can't you get a used one  for $3000?
Nice.  how much?  Are you trying to keep the economy going?
Testing.  Sell low and buy high ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2001  04:51 PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Phillip K Allen                           01/12/2001 08:58 AM 	  To: 8774820206@pagenetmessage.net cc:   Subject:   testing
Jeff,  Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.  1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs.  2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite  manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite.  3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.  My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.   Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price.  Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.  Phillip

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII] =20 VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 Dan

Jeff,  That is good news about Leander.    Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have  about $225K invested in the stagecoach,   it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.    I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee  and Jaques Craig can  work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a  second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. Checkout this spreadsheet.      These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.    However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy  show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some  trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the  time and I don't trust  Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from  now on.    I will have the operating statements complete through December by this  Friday.    Phillip
---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001  12:14 PM --------------------------- To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc:   Subject: Re: SM134    George,  Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders  profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip

One for the gas  generators is still quite a ways off.    The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting  back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back   I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate  would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time  soon.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.   Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is  dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.
George,   I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at  them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which  I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it  to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend.  Does  this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?  I just want to get a  feel for when you will start needing money.      Phillip
Patti,  This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps  in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to  be an interviewer?

While we anticipate many new Analysts  joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it  necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting  event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting  approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward  this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct  first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the  afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning  (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your  response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In  addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking  one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in  advance for your cooperation.       Thank you, Jana
Nick,  There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor  new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being  coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call  and he will fill you in on the details of the program.  Phillip

Lucy,  #32 and #29 are fine.    #28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid  260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He  either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the  middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a  big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.  Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent  you this morning.  Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.    Phillip
